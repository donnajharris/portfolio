                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>I can play <a href="#instrumental">several instruments</a>, but the piano is the <span class="punch-up">most proficient instrument</span> and <span class="punch-up">my first love</span>. I am a <span class="punch-up">classically-trained</span> pianist with a <span class="punch-up">Grade 10 Piano Certificate</span> from the Royal Conversatory of Music (Toronto, Canada). I also completed the Grade 3 and 4 Keyboard Harmony courses.</p>
                <p>I can play &quot;by ear&quot;, from chord charts, lead sheets, and written manuscripts, and I'm comfortable with a wide range of styles.</p>
                <p>My regular piano responsibilities continue as <span class="punch-up">a long-time accompanist</span> for The Salvation Army <a href="https://guelphsa.ca" target="_blank">Guelph Citadel</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> church services and choir. I also have experience accompanying others for  recordings, special occasions, auditions, juries, and festivals.</p>

I asked for their favourite carols and played improvisations with little to no editing. The styles were quite varied and this playlist shows that diversity.</p>
                  <p>Some of these tracks were used by The Salvation Army in Canada and Bermuda on their annual Christmas compilation recording in 2019 (&quot;What Child is This?&quot; and &quot;Hark The Herald Angels Sing&quot;) and 2020 (&quot;Rise Up Shepherd&quot; and &quot;We Three Kings&quot;).</p>

Released on Nov. 7, 2002, this album features my original arrangements of a number of hymns and songs and was made possible in large part by the late <a href="https://www.torontoaes.org/profile-ed-marshall/" target="_blank">Ted (Ed) Marshall</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> of Marshall Arts Productions.</p>
                  <p>This project was the first of many opportunities to work closely with my friend. Ted recorded, edited, and mastered the project. He gave me my first real look into the world of sound engineering.</p>
                  <p>The editing process was eye-opening. While most of these tracks were edited (a couple heavily <em>*cough*</em>), one or two were complete takes. I just wish I remembered which ones!!</p>
                  <p>The album was recorded in the beautiful <a href="https://www.humbercrest.ca/" target="_blank">Humbercrest United Church</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> sanctuary (Toronto, Canada) on their lovely grand piano in the summer of 2002.

                <h3>Voice</h3>
                <p>While I have no formal voice training, I am constantly surrounded by talented people who mentor, teach, and encourage. I also absorb everything I can from different adjudicators and leaders. My first vocal solo was a top secret novelty item I wrote for my sister's wedding reception. That moment lit something in me, laying the foundation for my love of solo performance.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://markedbylove.imperfectcadences.com" target="_blank">Marked By Love</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> vocal trio is featured throughout this portfolio. From 2016 to 2022 I sang alto in a wonderful Salvation Army SATB choir called <a href="https://salvationist.ca/canadian-staff-songsters/home/" target="_blank">The Canadian Staff Songsters</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span>. I have also both sung in and lead a number of choral groups and had the privilege to sing with choirs in two of Toronto's premiere concert halls, <a href="https://www.mhrth.com/" target="_blank">Roy Thomson Hall and Massey Hall</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span>.</p>

                  <p>In the mid-2000s, I started writing and then performing some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/olivepeople/sets/marked-by-love-tracks" target="_blank">female vocal trio arrangements</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> with two friends from church. This snowballed into having a regular backing band... naming the group... recording an album... singing across Southern Ontario... and recording another album. Our musical ministry together spanned over a decade.</p>
                  <p>The albums primarily feature <a href="#composition">my own compositions and arrangments</a>. Both Marked By Love albums (<span class="punch-up">Things Thought Impossible</span>, 2007 and <span class="punch-up">A Light in the Dark</span>, 2011) were recorded, editing, and mastered by Ted (Ed) Marshall of Marshall Arts Productions, using various multi-track techniques, allowing me to exercise my production and performance muscles in many different ways.</p>
                  <p>Both albums were recorded at The Salvation Army <a href="https://www.guelphsa.ca/" target="_blank">Guelph Citadel</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span>.

                <h3>Instrumental</h3>
                <p>I have been playing brass (first the cornet, then trumpet, French horn, flugelhorn, etc.) since I was around seven years old. (That's nearly as long as the piano!) Practical instruction was primarily through Salvation Army programs at church, music schools/camps, and bands, and complemented by public school music classes and ensembles. As a result, I have been immersed in ensemble playing for most of my life.</p>
                <p>I also have picked up other instruments through various opportunities over the years. While my favourite beyond piano and brass is likely percussion, my next most competent instrument is the acoustic guitar.</p>

                  <p>On December 6, 2014, I had the opportunity to present a Christmas-themed cornet solo at an annual community carol sing held at <a href="https://www.saintgeorge.ca/" target="_blank">St. George's Anglican Church</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> (Guelph, Canada) with the support of the Guelph Citadel Band of The Salvation Army led by a previous bandmaster, Allan Hicks.</p>

This moment was recorded by friends in the front row without my knowing. It captures a rare occasaion where I forget to be nervous. All I remember was the beautiful sound of the church sanctuary.</p>

                  <p>The joy of multi-track recording for a multi-instrumentalist like me is the chance to perform multiple parts at the same time.

                  <p>In this re-imagining of the hymn, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/olivepeople/all-my-work" target="_blank">All My Work is for the Master</a><span class="external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span>, I created and performed a gentle guitar accompaniment, with light percussive hits on the guitar body. (The additional improvisational guitar work was added by Doug Elvin.) It appears on the album <span class="punch-up">A Light In the Dark</span>.</p>
                  <p>A fun fact - the history of the guitar-accompanied Marked By Love trios is rooted in how I used to find it easier to accompany us live on a guitar than on the piano. This was also especially helpful when singing without our band at our church's Christmas Eve services.</p>

                <h3>Composition & Arrangements</h3>
                <p>Almost all of the <a href="#voice">Marked By Love vocal trios</a> are <span class="punch-up">original songs and arrangements</span> written by me. I have also written a number of <span class="punch-up">other compositions</span>, including SATB choral arrangements, brass band pieces, worship songs, and piano arrangements. I often joke that the song that will outlive them all is my silly little campfire song &quot;The Potato Song&quot;. Learn more about it in the <a href="#media">Media</a> section.</p>
                <p>Here is a collection of some of my favourite compositions and arrangements from the Marked By Love albums.</p>

                <p>It features an original melody, an homage to the original melody, and some cameo appearances by Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. Punched up by a brass section, this is a fun song to listen to and perform.</p>
