Version 0.1 features responsive header navigation for mobile viewports. These changes and a few minor tweaks went live on May 20, 2023.

Version 1 went live on June 21, 2023. It expanded the portfolio to include a first draft creative portfolio. It also introduced a landing page for choosing between the technical and creative portfolios.

Starting from Version 1, there is a viewable archive to demonstrate improvements and changes over time. This can be accessed at the ./wayback folder. Only the wayback index landing page and styles are explicitly tracked on GitHub.

Version 1.1 went live on July 7, 2023. It improves the performances of the Creative Portfolio by breaking it into multiple pages and reducing the size of some of the media. It has a similar style to V1, but has a much better responsive design.
