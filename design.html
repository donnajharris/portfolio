            <p>I'm <span class="punch-up">also super geeky</span> and have both studied and worked in different technology-based areas. (I've been immersed in computers all my life, too!)

This silly little campfire song I wrote many years ago seemed like a good outlet for working on some creative and technical skills while bringing people together. I am grateful to my friends who were willing to participate!</p>
          <p>The big challenge for this type of project was the wide variety of video and audio production quality submitted. The aim was to create something that captured the authentic feel of a fun community campfire singalong and, despite the challenges, I think this video does just that.</p>

          <p>The reason I include it here is to focus of the audio production aspect of the song. All of the instumental and vocal parts were performed by me. I also recorded, mixed, and mastered the track.</p>

Producing something a bit more quirky (...even more quirky?) than the standard videos was the focus.</p>
          <p>Here, I wrote, performed, recorded, and mixed a choral treatment of The Potato Song. I also created the animation of the &quot;Choral Potatoes&quot; using GIMP and Camtasia 2019.</p>

          <p>A more serious-natured project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsDJCmRTJsU" target="_blank">Our Prayers of Lament</a> focuses on expressing our hearts after one year into the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>
          <p>For this project, I did all of the video and audio editing. The piano track playing in the background is an improvised work of mine that was modified for this project. <a href="https://www.imperfectcadences.com/projects/our-prayers-of-lament/" target="_blank">Learn more about the project.</a></p>
          <p>Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJoUxxa_xWE" target="_blank">The Potato Song virtual campfire</a> before it, a big challenge for this project was the wide variety of video and audio production quality submitted by the participants. The aim was to create something that captured the authentic heart of a community of faith, and to do so in an artful and intimate way. I believe the end product reflects this and more.</p>

          <h3>Print</h3>
          <p>Over the years I have had opportunities to create print artifacts and have learned (sometimes the hard way) what works and what doesn't! Since ye olden days of print publishing software, like PrintMaster and PrintShop, I have enjoyed designing things on computers. I embrace chances to learn and experiment with design software as technology develops over time.</p>
          <p>As my awareness of <span class="punch-up">&quot;the end user&quot;</span> and <span class="punch-up">intended audience</span> has developed with work and life experience, my sense of design and its purpose has also been influenced for the better. I find myself <span class="punch-up">asking questions and testing</span> print products much like in software development.</p>

          <p>I did the majority of the design work for both of the Marked By Love albums, with assistance on some specific details.</p>
          <p>A less-than-fun fact - The cover of A Light in the Dark was a hard lesson learned, as I moved in haste to meet a deadline. The album cover was huge visual accessibility fail, as the contrast was extremely low when printed. These are lessons that have stuck with me, for which I'm grateful. And, I'm still quite proud of many other aspects of the booklet layout and design.</p>

          <p>I have been a remote technology volunteer for <a href="https://innercityhome.com/" target="_blank">Inner-City Home of Sudbury, Ontario</a> since January 2022.</p>
          <p>My first print project for Inner-City was a business card redesign. I created cards for specific personnel and also a blank contact card with room for writing in a name or note.</p>
          <p>Important features of the new design included the updated logo and motto (in both English and French) and both food bank locations. For this project, I used GIMP.</p>

          <p>Another print project for <a href="https://innercityhome.com/" target="_blank">Inner-City Home of Sudbury</a> was the donation receipt redesign. There were multiple receipt styles in use with various issues, such as not having enough room to write, not having good flow for the person filling it out, and not having the donation amounts right-aligned. The most recent version did not include the Inner-City logo or the bilingual name.</p>
          <p>The redesign addressed these issues and added a little style and colour. For this project, I used Adobe Illustrator CC 2022.</p>
