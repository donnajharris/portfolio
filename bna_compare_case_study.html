          <h2>BNA Compare Case Study</h2>

          <p>While working as a <span class="punch-up">Business Systems Analyst/QA Analyst</span> at Innosphere SDG Ltd., I took the initiative to leverage my technical skills to automate various aspects analysis and testing over the course of multiple years and multiple projects, starting with BNA Compare.</p>

          <p>The BNA Compare utility was created to integrate into existing regulatory library tools. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bna-ehs-products-add-new-tool-for-verifying-amendment-updates-125770028.html" target="_blank">Used to verify amendment updates</a> by comparing archived versions of regulatory and legal text.</p>

          <p>In short, the tool could show the differences between two different versions of the same regulation or law, underlining added text and striking out removed text.</p>

            <h3>UI Test Automation - Visual Testing</h3>

            <h4>The Problem to Solve</h4>
            <p>Initially, the problem was finding ways to avoid boredom. :)</p>
            <p>I also wanted to find appropriate and useful ways to use test automation -- not just do automation for the sake of automating tests.</p>
            <p>The BNA Compare tool had a very basic UI, and made a perfect candidate for exploring UI automation.</p>

            <h4>The Journey</h4>
            <p>While I had more experience with other languages, I decided to try learning Ruby.</p>
            <p>Using Ruby, I...</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Created Watir page objects to automate login and basic version comparisons</li>
              <li>Used Excel/CSV to drive login/regression and version comparison tests</li>
              <li>Setup Selenium Grid with virtual machines to test in different browsers/environments</li>
              <li>Took a screenshot at the end of every test to visually examine the results of the comparison test</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <p>I could setup many tests, on many browsers, press a button and walk away and do other things. Then check back on the results later.</p>
            <p>There was a season in the early development where I would need to regress many times in a day. It was awesome to have this effective, time-saving option.</p>

            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <p>Because of the nature of the implementation, the most important tests could not be reliably confirmed with an assertion at the end of the automated steps.</p>

            <h4>Long-term benefits</h4>
            <p>It became possible to hand over the review of the resultant screenshot to a junior team member, who could flag issues.</p>
            <p>Learning how to drive the UI from CSV and to take screenshots of results was a technique I returned to time and again for several years to come.</p>

            <h3>Code-Level Testing - Supporting the Developer</h3>

            <h4>The Problem to Solve</h4>
            <p>Our original team was small -- just me and one developer -- and the demands on his time were huge.</p>
            <p>He was a huge advocate for adding code-level testing and he wanted to add more, but wasn't finding the time.</p>

            <h4>The Journey</h4>
            <p>Knowing I was technically-inclined, developers often walked through their code with me. On this occasion, he suggested I try adding integration tests based on the one sample he had, testing between intermediary layers of translation.</p>
            <p>Using C#, I...</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Studied the existing NUnit test code, identifying what needed to change to test different cases -- then created one new test manually</li>
              <li>Created a Ruby script for generating the text of a single C# test case for provided parameters</li>
              <li>Used Excel/CSV to list parameters for the C# tests to generate in bulk</li> 
              <li>Added the generated C# tests to the codebase/li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <p>Even with only a loose grasp of C#, I could create test cases and test code far quicker than the developer could, even if he had the time.</p>
            <p>With the initial dataset in particular, this caught a number of regressions before it even got to me to take a look at.</p>
            <p>I was exposed to the main codebase.</p>

            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <p>It only covered one aspect (although, it was a helpful one!) and had limited value after the code stabilized.</p>

            <h4>Long-term benefits</h4>
            <p>As far as I recall, this specific kind of testing did not carry forward into datasets after the original one -- but its legacy of getting so many of the growing pains of the development approach sorted early definitely carried forward.</p>
            <p>* Note: There would have been other code-level tests in the codebase. I just wasn't involved with creating, running, or maintaining those.</p>
