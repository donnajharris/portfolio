        <h1>All About BNA Compare</h1>

        <p>What problem(s) were you trying to solve?

          What advantages did you discover?
          
          What disadvantages?
          
          What benefits were discovered long-term?
          
          </p>

          <p>UI Automation - visual testing
            1) Watir page objects with Ruby
            2) Excel/CSV to drive comparisons and login/regression tests
            3) Selenium Grid with Ruby to test in different browsers/environments (virtual machines)
            4) get screenshots to visually examine the results/comparisons</p>
            <p>Code-level testing - support to dev
            1) discussions about what benefits and how; what already existed
            2) dev showed me the integration tests he had, between intermediary layers of translation; invited me to add more based on test ideas I had
            3) I studied the C# NUnit test code, manually identified what needed to change to test different cases, created a new test manually
            4) I created a list of tests in a Excel/CSV document, with the parts of the test cases that needed to change â€“ and wrote a script that generated the corresponding C# tests
            5) added them to the codebase</p>
            <p>Analysis of XML dataset
            1) Ruby script to interrogate the XML to identify all elements and attributes in existing data
            2) Used this information to find REAL examples of various differences between versions, location of specific elements, etc.
            3) Helped us to dig deeper</p>
            <p>Creation of XML test data
            1) I studied the XML data files and determined the smallest possible structure for creating test data.
            2) I created a list of tests in a Excel/CSV document, identifying the element under test.
            3) I created a Ruby script to generate test files and scenarios
            4) I leveraged the UI Test automation code and could run a series of tests (with screenshots), after loading the data to a test server</p>
            <p>New Datasets
            1) Leveraged and improved on techniques of analysis and testing for three more Compare Tool datasets
            2) Leveraged data analysis and test data generation experiences for a totally different XML-like dataset, with good success
