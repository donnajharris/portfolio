          <h2>Developing Dine Around</h2>
          <img class="logo" src="./cp670s21fp/DineAroundAppIcon.jpg" width="20%"><p><span class="punch-up">Dine Around</span> was built as an Android development course final project. Our team of five built an app for tracking favourite restaurants, coffee shops, and bars.</p>
          <p>My responsibilities and my confidence grew throughout the duration of the project.</p>
          <p>I volunteered to take care of the app logo (created by combining and editing two Ballicon icons), which proved to be a precursor to handling the design and implementation of the app's lists of "Places" and "Favourite Places".</p>
          <p>With guidance from a professionally experiened developer on the team, I got my feet wet with developing the main list of places. And then, I was able to really make both the design layout and the implementation my own, with regular feedback from the team.</p>
          <p>I was able to successfully build out my features with the knowledge of other components that needed to integrate. We were able to work together to connect pieces and troubleshoot issues.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, <span class="punch-up">the repository is not public at this time</span>. What follows provides some insights into the app as well as my involvmenet in development and testing.</p>

          <h3>Places Lists</h3>

          <div class="code-container">
            <ul class="code-example">Code Examples:
              <li><a href="./cp670s21fp/PlacesListAdapter.java" target="_blank">PlacesListAdapter.java</a></li>
              <li><a href="./cp670s21fp/place_item.xml" target="_blank">place_item.xml</a></li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="img-displayer">
            <p class="center-description"><span class="punch-up">All Places:</span> These sample &quot;All Places&quot; lists show restaurants, coffee shops, and bars with various metadata, including ratings and favourites, open status and distance, if nearby.</p>

          <div class="img-displayer">
            <p class="center-description"><span class="punch-up">place_item.xml</span> defines the card layout for the All Places and Favourite Places lists. This screenshot of VS Code shows the XML file and resulting card layout using sample text.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

      
          <h3>Language Support</h3>

          <div class="code-container">
            <ul class="code-example">Code Example:
              <li><a href="./cp670s21fp/strings.xml" target="_blank">strings.xml (French)</a></li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Our application supported three languages: English, French, and Portugese. (It was a required element to support multiple languages.</p>

          <p>My role was to ensure that all strings were labelled and translated accordingly. I provided the French for the app and much of the English.</p>

          <p>The different languages impacted the UI layout, as some languages have longer or shorter words or phrases than others. It was an interesting challenge to update the layout for this purpose. The VS Code image of the place_item.xml layout shows the test strings used late in the project, including the longest words and phrases explicitly used by the application.</p>

          <h2>Testing Dine Around</h2>

          <p>While there was much manual regression and feature testing all throughout the project, there was a requirement to provide unit testing in the codebase.</p>

          <p>A number of helper classes containing business logic were relatively well isolated. As a result, these could be tested directly, making them good candidates for code-level test automation.</p>

          <p>I provided tests for the code I wrote, as well as some other helper classes. Below, I include test code and the file under test for these instances.</p>
