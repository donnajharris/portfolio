          <p>I am a <span class="punch-up">curious, sensitive, creative soul</span> with a goofy dog named Shiloh and an interest in almost everything and everybody! I have been <span class="punch-up">immersed in musical and artistic pursuits</span> all my life in so many different ways. There's no sign of stopping, either. This portfolio highlights my <span class="punch-up">creative skills and experiences</span>.</p>
          <p>I'm <span class="punch-up">also super geeky</span> and have both studied and worked in different technology-based areas. (I've been immersed in computers all my life, too!)</p>
          <p>If you're interested in learning more about those kinds of skills, please head over to my <a href="./technical.html"><span class="technical-portfolio-link">Technical Portfolio.</span></a></p>

              <p>I met Donna a few thousand years ago... we have become good friends. Donna <span class="punch-up">composed a song for me</span> for the opening of Brantford's new Salvation Army building and <span class="punch-up">helped me record it</span> for a CD project.</p>
              <p>She invited me to participate in a concert given by her group <span class="punch-up external-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#composition">Marked By Love</a></span> and also in her annual Songster music reading evenings. We were on faculty together at a music camp once and served together in the <a href="https://salvationist.ca/canadian-staff-songsters/home/" target="_blank">Canadian Staff Songsters</a><span class="punch-up external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span>.</p>
              <p>Donna taught me to count to purple backwards and got me on Facebook. Donna also has &quot;taken this soprano for a test drive&quot; when helping me warm up. ðŸ˜‹</p>
