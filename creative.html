          <p>I am a curious, sensitive, creative soul with a goofy dog named Shiloh and an interest in almost everything and everybody! I have been immersed in musical and artistic pursuits all of my life, in so many shapes and forms. There's no sign of stopping either. This portfoliio highlights some of my creative skills and projects and provides a place for me to share some of my experiences and background.</p>
          <p>I'm also super geeky and have studied and worked in a lot of different technology-based areas. (I've been immersed in computers all my life too!) So, if you're interested in learning more about those kinds of skills, please head on over to my <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Technical Portfolio</a> and take a look.</p>

                  <h3>Piano</h3>
                  <p>I can play <a href="#instrumental">several instruments</a>, but the piano is definitely my first love and most proficient instrument.</p>
                  <p>Playing since I could first reach the keyboard, I am a classically-trained pianist. I have a Grade 10 Piano Certificate from the Royal Conversatory of Music (Toronto, Canada). I also successfully completed the Grade 3 and 4 Keyboard Harmony courses. I can play &quot;by ear&quot;, from chord charts, lead sheets, and written manuscripts, and I'm comfortable with a wide range of styles.</p>
                  <p>My regular piano responsibilities continue as a long-time piano pianist and accompanist for The Salvation Army <a href="https://guelphsa.ca" target="_blank">Guelph Citadel</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-xiW8bfgSizu-MvzrTm_6A" target="_blank">church services</a> and church choir (known as the Songsters). I also have experience accompanying soloists for special occasions, post-secondary auditions and performance juries, and the Guelph Kiwanis Festival.</p>

I asked for their favourite carols and played improvisations with little to no editing. The styles were quite varied and this playlist shows that diversity.</p>
                    <p>Some of these tracks were used by The Salvation Army in Canada and Bermuda on their annual Christmas compilation recording in 2019 (What Child is This? and Hark The Herald Angels Sing) and 2020 (Rise Up Shepherd and We Three Kings).</p>

                    <p>&quot;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/olivepeople/sets/this-is-my-story" target="_blank">This Is My Story</a>&quot; was originally released in audio CD format for the Guelph Citadel Salvation Army building project fund. Released on Nov. 7, 2002, this recording was made possible by the late <a href="https://www.torontoaes.org/profile-ed-marshall/" target="_blank">Ted (Edward) Marshall</a> of Marshall Arts Productions.</p>
                    <p>This project was the first of many opportunities to work closely with my friend. Ted recorded, edited, and mastered the project. He gave me my first real look into the world of sound engineering.</p>
                    <p>The editing process was eye-opening. While most of these tracks were edited (a couple heavily <em>*cough*</em>), one or two were complete takes. I just wish I remembered which ones!!</p>
                    <p>The album was recorded in the beautiful <a href="https://www.humbercrest.ca/" target="_blank">Humbercrest United Church</a> sanctuary (Toronto, Canada) on their lovely grand piano in the summer of 2002. The album artwork was designed by Ted's son, Len Marshall, of <a href="https://quietcitydesign.com/" target="_blank">Quiet City Design</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Voice</h3>
                  <p>One of my favourite instruments is the easiest to carry: the voice.</p>
                  <p>While I have no formal voice training, I have benefited greatly from being surrounded by a lot of talented people who have mentored, taught, and encouraged me over the years. I also listen keenly whenever I'm accompanying and learn a lot from different adjudicators and conductors.</p>
                  <p>I didn't open my mouth to sing a solo until my sister's wedding reception. It was a huge surprise and nobody saw it coming. It was great fun - a novelty number which was top secret until reception. But, this first solo also started something because I learned how much I love to sing as a soloist.</p>
                  <p>While my vocal trio Marked By Love is featured throughout this portfolio, I also had the opportunity to sing alto in a wonderful Salvation Army SATB choral group called <a href="https://salvationist.ca/canadian-staff-songsters/home/" target="_blank">The Canadian Staff Songsters</a> for its first seven years of (modern) existence.</p>

                    <p>Most of my virtual church service contributions were preparing a requested congregational song or two at home, in my little room. These arrangements were created by me, recorded and performed simultaneously, usually in a whole take. The audio and video production was also mine to manage, as was often the case throughout pandemic days.</p>

                    <p>In the mid-2000s, I started writing and then performing some female vocal trio arrangements with a couple of friends from church. This snowballed into having a regular backing instrumental trio. Then naming the group Marked By Love... recording an album... singing all over Southern Ontario... and then recording a second album. The group had a good run of musical ministry for well over a decade.</p>
                    <p>The albums primarily feature my own compositions and arrangments. Both Marked By Love albums were recorded, editing, and mastered by Ted (Ed) Marshall of Marshall Arts Productions, using various multi-track techniques, allowing me to exercise my production and performance muscles in many different ways.</p>
                    <p>Both albums were recorded at The Salvation Army <a href="https://www.guelphsa.ca/" target="_blank">Guelph Citadel</a>.

                  <p>I've been playing the cornet (and subsequently the trumpet, flugelhorn, etc.) since I was around 7 years old. So, nearly as long as piano! With practical learning through Salvation Army programs at church, music schools/camps, and bands, I have been immersed in ensemble playing for most of my life.</p>
                  <p>I also have picked up other instruments through various opportunities over the years. While my favourite is likely percussion, my next most competent instrument after brass is the acoustic guitar.</p>

(The additional improvisational guitar work was added by Doug Elvin.)</p>
                    <p>A fun fact - the history of the guitar-accompanied Marked By Love trios is rooted in how I used to find it easier to accompany us live on a guitar than on the piano. This was also especially helpful when singing without our band at our church's Christmas Eve services.</p></div>

                  <h3>Composition & Arrangements</h3>
                  <p>Almost all of the Marked By Love vocal trios are original songs or arrangements written by me. While these songs are likely my most publicly known body of work, I have written a number of SATB choral arrangements, brass band compositions, worship songs, and piano arrangements. The only song that might surpass them all is a silly little campfire song called &quot;The Potato Song&quot;. (Learn more about The Potato Song in the <a href="#media">Media</a> section.)</p>
                  <p>Here is a collection of some of my favourite compositions and arrangements from the Marked By Love albums.</p>

                <p>For many years, I have had opportunities to create print artifacts and have learned (sometimes the hard way) what works and what doesn't! Since the days of print software like PrintMaster and PrintShop, I have enjoyed designing things on a computer. I embrace opportunities to learn and experiment with design software as technology develops over time.</p>
                <p>As my awareness of &quot;the end user&quot; or intended audience has developed more keenly with experience, my sense of design and purpose has also been influenced for the better. I find myself asking questions and testing print products much like in software development.</p>

                <p><b>Marked By Love CD booklets.</b></p>
                <p>I did the majority of the design work for both of the Marked By Love albums, with assistance on some specific details.</p>
                <p>A less-than-fun fact - The cover of A Light in the Dark was a hard lesson learned, as I moved in haste to meet a deadline. The album cover was huge visual accessibility fail, as the contrast was extremely low when printed. These are lessons that have stuck with me, for which I'm grateful. And, I'm still quite proud of many other aspects of the booklet layout and design.</p>

                <p>My first print project for Inner-City was a business card redesign. I created cards for specific personnel and also a blank contact card with room for writing in a name or note.</p>
                <p>Important features of the new design included the updated logo and motto (in both English and French) and both food bank locations. For this project, I used GIMP.</p></div>

                <p>Another print project for <a href="https://innercityhome.com/" target="_blank">Inner-City Home of Sudbury</a> was the donation receipt redesign. There were multiple receipt styles in use with various issues, such as not having enough room to write, not having good flow for the person filling it out, and not having the donation amounts right-aligned. The most recent version did not include the Inner-City logo or the bilingual name.</p>
                <p>The redesign addressed these issues and added a little style and colour. For this project, I used Adobe Illustrator CC 2022.</p>

                <p>I have worked professionally as a college instructor, but I have been teaching all my life. Part of my natural tendency is to help others and to share information, so even as a child I was helping and teaching peers and adults alike. I started teaching music as a young teen, both privately and through church programs. Beginning in my twenties, I started teaching through Salvation Army music camps and also took on educational positions during my undergrad studies.</p>
                <p>I bring a teacher's heart to every role and many skills have been grown and expanded simply for the joy of sharing with others.</p>

                  <li>how to create our own text substitutions</li>
