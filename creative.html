            <p>I am a <span class="punch-up">curious, sensitive, creative soul</span> with a goofy dog named Shiloh and an interest in almost everything and everybody! I have been <span class="punch-up">immersed in musical and artistic pursuits</span> all my life in so many different ways. There's no sign of stopping, either. This portfolio highlights my <span class="punch-up">creative skills and experiences</span>.</p>
            <p>I'm <span class="punch-up">also super geeky</span> and have both studied and worked in different technology-based areas. (I've been immersed in computers all my life, too!)

                  <p>I can play <a href="#instrumental">several instruments</a>, but the piano is the <span class="punch-up">most proficient instrument</span> and <span class="punch-up">my first love</span>.

                  <p>I can play &quot;by ear&quot;, from chord charts, lead sheets, and written manuscripts, and I'm comfortable with a wide range of styles.</p>
                  <p>My regular piano responsibilities continue as <span class="punch-up">a long-time accompanist</span> for The Salvation Army <a href="https://guelphsa.ca" target="_blank">Guelph Citadel</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-xiW8bfgSizu-MvzrTm_6A" target="_blank">church services</a> and choir.

I asked for their favourite carols and played improvisations with little to no editing. The styles were quite varied and this playlist shows that diversity.</p>
                    <p>Some of these tracks were used by The Salvation Army in Canada and Bermuda on their annual Christmas compilation recording in 2019 (&quot;What Child is This?&quot; and &quot;Hark The Herald Angels Sing&quot;) and 2020 (&quot;Rise Up Shepherd&quot; and &quot;We Three Kings&quot;).</p>

Released on Nov. 7, 2002, this album features my original arrangements of a number of hymns and songs and was made possible in large part by the late <a href="https://www.torontoaes.org/profile-ed-marshall/" target="_blank">Ted (Ed) Marshall</a> of Marshall Arts Productions.</p>
                    <p>This project was the first of many opportunities to work closely with my friend. Ted recorded, edited, and mastered the project. He gave me my first real look into the world of sound engineering.</p>
                    <p>The editing process was eye-opening. While most of these tracks were edited (a couple heavily <em>*cough*</em>), one or two were complete takes. I just wish I remembered which ones!!</p>
                    <p>The album was recorded in the beautiful <a href="https://www.humbercrest.ca/" target="_blank">Humbercrest United Church</a> sanctuary (Toronto, Canada) on their lovely grand piano in the summer of 2002. The album artwork was designed by Ted's son, Len Marshall, of <a href="https://quietcitydesign.com/" target="_blank">Quiet City Design</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Voice</h3>
                  <p>One of my favourite instruments is the easiest to carry: the voice.</p>
                  <p>While I have no formal voice training, I have benefited greatly from being surrounded by a lot of talented people who have mentored, taught, and encouraged me over the years. I also listen keenly whenever I'm accompanying and learn a lot from different adjudicators and conductors.</p>
                  <p>I didn't open my mouth to sing a solo until my sister's wedding reception. It was a huge surprise and nobody saw it coming. It was great fun - a novelty number which was top secret until reception. But, this first solo also started something because I learned how much I love to sing as a soloist.</p>
                  <p>While my vocal trio <a href="https://markedbylove.imperfectcadences.com" target="_blank">Marked By Love</a> is featured throughout this portfolio, I also had the opportunity to sing alto in a wonderful Salvation Army SATB choral group called <a href="https://salvationist.ca/canadian-staff-songsters/home/" target="_blank">The Canadian Staff Songsters</a> for its first seven years of (modern) existence.</p>

                    <p>In the mid-2000s, I started writing and then performing some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/olivepeople/sets/marked-by-love-tracks" target="_blank">female vocal trio arrangements</a> with two friends from church. This snowballed into having a regular backing band... naming the group... recording an album... singing across Southern Ontario... and recording another album. Our musical ministry together spanned over a decade.</p>
                    <p>The albums primarily feature <a href="#composition">my own compositions and arrangments</a>. Both Marked By Love albums (<span class="punch-up">Things Thought Impossible</span>, 2007 and <span class="punch-up">A Light in the Dark</span>, 2011) were recorded, editing, and mastered by Ted (Ed) Marshall of Marshall Arts Productions, using various multi-track techniques, allowing me to exercise my production and performance muscles in many different ways.</p>
                    <p>Both albums were recorded at The Salvation Army <a href="https://www.guelphsa.ca/" target="_blank">Guelph Citadel</a>.

                  <h3>Instrumental</h3>
                  <p>I have been playing the cornet (and subsequently the trumpet, flugelhorn, etc.) since I was around 7 years old. So, that's nearly as long as the piano! With practical learning through Salvation Army programs at church, music schools/camps, and bands, I have been immersed in ensemble playing for most of my life.</p>
                  <p>I also have picked up other instruments through various opportunities over the years. While my favourite is likely percussion, my next most competent instrument after brass is the acoustic guitar.</p>

                    <p>On December 6, 2014, I had the opportunity to present a Christmas-themed cornet solo at an annual community carol sing held at St. George's Anglican Church, Guelph, with the support of the Guelph Citadel Band of The Salvation Army led by Bandmaster Allan Hicks.</p>
                    <p>The brass band arrangement of <a href="https://samusicindex.com/brass/in-the-bleak-mid-winter/4120" target="_blank">In the Bleak Midwinter</a> was masterfully arranged by Trevor Worthington. This moment was recorded by friends in the front row without my knowing. It captures a rare occasaion where I forget to be nervous. All I remember was the beautiful sound of the church sanctuary.</p>

                    <p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/olivepeople/all-my-work" target="_blank">this re-imagining of the hymn</a> "All My Work is for the Master", I created and performed a gentle guitar accompaniment, with light percussive hits on the guitar body. (The additional improvisational guitar work was added by Doug Elvin.) It appears on the album <span class="punch-up">A Light In the Dark</span>.</p>
                    <p>A fun fact - the history of the guitar-accompanied Marked By Love trios is rooted in how I used to find it easier to accompany us live on a guitar than on the piano. This was also especially helpful when singing without our band at our church's Christmas Eve services.</p>

This silly little campfire song I wrote many years ago seemed like a good outlet for working on some creative and technical skills while bringing people together. I am grateful to my friends who were willing to participate!</p>
                  <p>The big challenge for this type of project was the wide variety of video and audio production quality submitted. The aim was to create something that captured the authentic feel of a fun community campfire singalong and, despite the challenges, I think this video does just that.</p>

                  <p>The reason I include it here is to focus of the audio production aspect of the song. All of the instumental and vocal parts were performed by me. I also recorded, mixed, and mastered the track.</p>

                  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_3L3yWJFYU" target="_blank">Choral Potatoes</a> was one of the most fun, most indulgent videos of entire <a href="https://www.imperfectcadences.com/projects/the-potato-song-project/" target="_blank">The Potato Song Project</a>. Producing something a bit more quirky (...even more quirky?) than the standard videos was the focus.</p>
                  <p>Here, I wrote, performed, recorded, and mixed a choral treatment of The Potato Song. I also created the animation of the &quot;Choral Potatoes&quot; using GIMP and Camtasia 2019.</p>

                  <p>A more serious-natured project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsDJCmRTJsU" target="_blank">Our Prayers of Lament</a> focuses on expressing our hearts after one year into the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>
                  <p>For this project, I did all of the video and audio editing. The piano track playing in the background is an improvised work of mine that was modified for this project. <a href="https://www.imperfectcadences.com/projects/our-prayers-of-lament/" target="_blank">Learn more about the project.</a></p>
                  <p>Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJoUxxa_xWE" target="_blank">The Potato Song virtual campfire</a> before it, a big challenge for this project was the wide variety of video and audio production quality submitted by the participants. The aim was to create something that captured the authentic heart of a community of faith, and to do so in an artful and intimate way. I believe the end product reflects this and more.</p>

                  <p>Over the years I have had opportunities to create print artifacts and have learned (sometimes the hard way) what works and what doesn't! Since ye olden days of print publishing software, like PrintMaster and PrintShop, I have enjoyed designing things on computers. I embrace chances to learn and experiment with design software as technology develops over time.</p>
                  <p>As my awareness of <span class="punch-up">&quot;the end user&quot;</span> and <span class="punch-up">intended audience</span> has developed with work and life experience, my sense of design and its purpose has also been influenced for the better.

                  <p>A less-than-fun fact - The cover of A Light in the Dark was a hard lesson learned, as I moved in haste to meet a deadline. The album cover was huge visual accessibility fail, as the contrast was extremely low when printed. These are lessons that have stuck with me, for which I'm grateful. And, I'm still quite proud of many other aspects of the booklet layout and design.</p>

                  <p>My first print project for Inner-City was a business card redesign. I created cards for specific personnel and also a blank contact card with room for writing in a name or note.</p>
                  <p>Important features of the new design included the updated logo and motto (in both English and French) and both food bank locations. For this project, I used GIMP.</p>

There were multiple receipt styles in use with various issues, such as not having enough room to write, not having good flow for the person filling it out, and not having the donation amounts right-aligned. The most recent version did not include the Inner-City logo or the bilingual name.</p>
                  <p>The redesign addressed these issues and added a little style and colour. For this project, I used Adobe Illustrator CC 2022.</p>

                <p>I met Donna a few thousand years ago... we have become good friends. Donna <span class="punch-up">composed a song for me</span> for the opening of Brantford's new Salvation Army building and <span class="punch-up">helped me record it</span> for a CD project.</p>
                <p>She invited me to participate in a concert given by her group <span class="punch-up"><a href="#composition">Marked By Love</a></span> and also in her annual Songster music reading evenings. We were on faculty together at a music camp once and served together in the <span class="punch-up"><a href="https://salvationist.ca/canadian-staff-songsters/home/" target="_blank">Canadian Staff Songsters</a></span>.</p>
                <p>Donna taught me to count to purple backwards and got me on Facebook. Donna also has &quot;taken this soprano for a test drive&quot; when helping me warm up. 😋</p>
