        <p class="bio">I am a curious, sensitive, creative soul with a goofy dog named Shiloh and an interest in almost everything and everybody! I have been in immersed in musical and artistic pursuits all of my life, in so many shapes and forms. There's no sign of stopping either.</p>
        <p class="bio">Here, I try to highlight various skills and projects, as well as sharing some of my experiences and background.</p>
        <p class="bio">I'm also super geeky and have studied and worked in a lot of different technology-based areas. (I've been immersed in computers all my life too!) So, if you're interested in learning more about those kinds of skills, please head on over to my <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Technical Portfolio</a> and take a look.</p>

              <h3>Piano</h3>
              <p>I can play a lot of instruments, but the piano is my primary and most proficient instrument without a doubt.</p>
              <p>Playing since I could first reach its keyboard, I am classically-trained, with a Grade 10 Piano Certificate and Grade 3 and 4 Keyboard Harmony courses from the Royal Conversatory of Music (Toronto, Canada). I can play "by ear", from chord charts, lead sheets, and written manuscripts. Comfortable with a wide range of styles.</p>
              <p>My main piano responsibilities continue as a long-time piano accompanist for The Salvation Army Guelph Citadel church services and church choir. I also have experience accompanying soloists for auditions, performaance juries, and Kiwanis Festivals.</p>

Released on Nov. 7, 2002, this recording was made possible by the late Ted (Ed) Marshall of Marshall Arts Productions, my first of many opportunities to work with my friend. Ted recorded, edited, and mastered the project, and gave me my first deep insights into the world of sound engineering.</p><p>The editing process was eye-opening. While most tracks were edited (a couple, heavily *cough*) one or two were complete takes. I wish I remembered which ones!!</p><p>The album was recorded in Toronto on the lovely grand piano at Humbercrest United Church in the summer of 2002.

              <h3>Voice</h3>
              <p>One of my favourite instruments is the easiest to carry: the voice.</p>
              <p>While I have no formal voice training, I have benefited greatly from being surrounded by a lot of talented people who have mentored, taught, and encouraged me over the years. I also listen keenly whenever I'm accompanying and learn a lot from different adjudicators and conductors.</p>
              <p>I didn't open my mouth to sing a solo until my sister's wedding reception. It was a huge surprise and nobody saw it coming. It was great fun - a novelty number I wrote in secret. But it also started something... showing me how much I love to sing as a soloist.</p><p>I also had the opportunity to sing in a wonderful Salvation Army choral group called The Canadian Staff Songsters for its first seven years.</p>

The group had a good run of musical ministry for well over a decade.</p><p>The albums primarily feature my own compositions and arrangments. Both Marked By Love albums were recorded, editing, and mastered by Ted (Ed) Marshall of Marshall Arts Productions, using various multi-track techniques, allowing me to exercise production and performance muscles in many directions.</p><p><a href="https://markedbylove.imperfectcadences.com" target="_blank">Marked By Love website</a></p></div>

              <h3>Instrumental</h3>
              <p>I've been playing the cornet (and subsequently the trumpet, flugelhorn, etc.) since I was around 7 years old. So, nearly as long as piano! With practical learning through Salvation Army programs at church, music schools/camps, and bands, I have been immersed in ensemble playing for most of my life.</p>
              <p>I also have picked up other instruments through various opportunities over the years. While my favourite is likely percussion, my next most competent instrument after brass is the acoustic guitar.</p>

              <h3>Composition & Arrangements</h3>
              <p>Almost all of the Marked By Love vocal trios are original songs or arrangements. While this is likely my most publicly known body of work, I have written a number of SATB choral arrangements, brass band compositions, worship songs, and piano arrangements. The only song that might surpass them all is a silly little campfire song called the Potato Song. (See more about The Potato song in the <a href="#media">Media</a> section.)</p>
              <p>Here is a collection of some of my favourite compositions and arrangements from the Marked By Love albums.</p>

          <p>I have worked professionally as a college instructor, but I have been teaching all my life. Part of my natural tendency is to help others and to share information, so even as a child I was helping and teaching peers and adults alike. I started teaching music as a young teen, both privately and through church programs. Beginning in my twenties, I started teaching through Salvation Army music camps and also took on educational positions during my undergrad studies.</p><p>I bring my a teacher's heart to every role and many skills have been grown and expanded for the joy of sharing with others.</p><p>The examples provided here are specifically tied to the educational side of my emerging brand, Foundational Things.</p>
